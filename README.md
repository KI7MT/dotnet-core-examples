# .NET Core Examples

Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced Single File .NET Core Application Examples

This directory contains examples that you can use to test out [.NET Core](http://dotnet.github.io).
Each section contains one or more applications. Each application can be described
as follows:

* **Introductory** - basic applications that any entry level programmer can grasp.
* **Intermediate** - employs things such as structures, and methods from outside
of the main method.
* **Advanced** - are applications that use a combination of both Introduction and
Intermediate. They may also use instance classes, interfaces, extend classes, 
or more advanced [Object Oriented Programming (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
techniques.

The majority of the programs are a Single File. They are simple to use, and 
can be compiled on any Operating System capable of running the 
[.Net Core SDK](http://dotnet.github.io/getting-started/).

## Running The Examples

In order to run the examples, you must [install .NET Core](http://dotnet.github.io/getting-started/).
After that, you can clone the repository, navigate to the example folders and:

* Build / Run by issuing the following commands
	* `dotnet restore`
	* `dotnet run`

## Samples list

* **Advanced.Employee.Commission** - Calculates one ore more Employees commission,
saves to an array of structures, then prints a summary.
* **Advanced.TicTacToe** - Console game Tic-Tac-Toe that uses more advanced
features such as 2D arrays, and external methods.
* **Intermediate.Employee.Commission** - Similar to advanced, but only uses If,
If-Else and for-loops for construction.
* **Intermediate.methods** - several simple calculators
that use methods external to the main method for computation.
* **Intermediate.structs** - simple MLS and Job listings applications that use
structs.
* **Intro.arrays** - examples of using arrays to perform calculations.
* **Intro.for-loops** - various implementations of using for-loops to
draw shapes, perform countdowns, and determine values.
* **Intro.if-else** - several entry level if-else statement examples.
* **Inteo.while-loops** - simple high-low game, account balance, payment plan, and calculators.
