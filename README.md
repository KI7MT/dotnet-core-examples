# .NET Core Examples

Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced Single File .NET Core Application Examples

This directory contains samples that you can use to test out [.NET Core](http://dotnet.github.io).
Each second may contain one or more applications. Each application set is described
as follows:

* Introductory: basic applications that any entry level programmer could use.
* Intermediate: employs things such as structures, methods from outside of the
main method, and complex arrays
* Advanced: are applications that use a combination of both Introduction and
Intermediate. They may also use instance classes, interfaces, and more advanced
[OOP - Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
techniques.

The majority of the programs are a Single File. They are simple to use, and 
can be compiled on any Operating System that can [install .Net Core SDK]([install .NET Core](http://dotnet.github.io/getting-started/).
