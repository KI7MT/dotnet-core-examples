# .NET Core Examples

Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced Single File .NET Core Application Examples

This directory contains examples that you can use to test out [.NET Core](http://dotnet.github.io).
Each section contains one or more applications. Each application can be described
as follows:

* Introductory: basic applications that any entry level programmer could use.
* Intermediate: employs things such as structures, methods from outside of the
main method, and complex arrays
* Advanced: are applications that use a combination of both Introduction and
Intermediate. They may also use instance classes, interfaces, and more advanced
[Object Oriented Programming (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
techniques.

The majority of the programs are a Single File. They are simple to use, and 
can be compiled on any Operating System capable of running the 
[.Net Core SDK]([install .NET Core](http://dotnet.github.io/getting-started/).

## How to run the samples?

In order to run these examples, you must [install .NET Core](http://dotnet.github.io/getting-started/).
After that, you can clone the repository, navigate to the example folders and:

	* `dotnet run`

## Samples list

* **dotnetbot** - Let dotnetbot say Hi!
* **helloworld** - because no sample is complete without Hello World!
